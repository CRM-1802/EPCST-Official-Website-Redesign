<p id="description">This design is a modernized redesign of our Software Engineering 1 and 2 project. The goal is to adhere to contemporary UI/UX standards with a strong focus on layout structure typographic hierarchy and overall user-centric design. While the original iteration—created by our previous designer—already applied similar principles my approach aims to simplify the interface further and enhance text readability. Since our school currently does not have an official website I am developing this prototype in Figma as both a creative exercise and a potential concept to present to the school administration giving them a clear vision of what their website could look like.</p>
